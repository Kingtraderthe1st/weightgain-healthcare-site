Start the Vite development server for local testing.

Steps:
1. Check if port 5173 is already in use with `lsof -i :5173`
2. If the port is in use, report what's running and ask if I should kill it
3. Run `npm run dev` in the background to start the Vite dev server
4. Confirm the server is running and accessible at http://localhost:5173
