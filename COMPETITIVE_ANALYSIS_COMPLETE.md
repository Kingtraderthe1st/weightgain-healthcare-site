# Part 3: Detailed Competitive Analysis

## 1. Competitor Pricing Models Analysis

### All-Inclusive Models (Customer Preferred)

These competitors charge a single monthly fee that includes consultations, medication, labs, and monitoring:

| Company | Monthly Price | Model Details | Customer Rating |
|---------|--------------|---------------|-----------------|
| **Maximus** | $329/month | All-inclusive, custom formulas (cream/injectable/oral) | 4.0/5 (701 reviews) |

| **Voy** | £99-169/month ($99-169) | All-inclusive, UK-based | Not specified |
| **WeightGain** | $249/month | All-inclusive, personalized protocols | **COMPETITIVE** |

**Key Insight:** Customers appreciate knowing total cost upfront. All-inclusive models eliminate surprise charges and build trust.

### Membership + Separate Fees Models (Customer Disliked)

These competitors advertise low monthly fees but charge medications, labs, and other services separately:

| Company | Advertised Price | Actual Total Cost | Hidden Fees Issue |
|---------|-----------------|-------------------|-------------------|
| **Hone Health** | $129/month membership | $157-189/month actual | +$28-60/month medication |
| **Vault Health** | $129-249/month membership | $200-350+/month actual | +medication costs |
| **PeterMD** | Similar to Hone | Similar hidden fees | Membership + medication separate |

**Critical Finding:** Customers report total costs are **2-3x higher** than advertised prices. This is the #1 complaint across the industry.

### Lab-Only Models

| Company | Price | What's Included | Rating |
|---------|-------|-----------------|--------|
| **Function Health** | $365/year ($1/day) | 160+ lab tests annually, 2x per year, NO medication | 4.3/5 (616 reviews) |
