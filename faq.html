                Yes, we recommend fasting for 8-12 hours before your blood draw for the most
                accurate results. Water is allowed and encouraged. Schedule your appointment for the
                morning if possible.

                Lab results typically arrive within 3-5 business days after your blood draw. Our

              <p>
                When properly monitored by qualified physicians, hormone optimization may be safe
                and effective for many individuals. We use bioidentical hormones at physiological
                doses and monitor your levels quarterly. Our protocol recommendations follow
                evidence-based guidelines from endocrinology societies. However, individual results
                and safety profiles vary, and hormone therapy is not appropriate for everyone.
                Always consult with your physician about your specific health situation.
